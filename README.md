This project was my attempt to use the package https://github.com/matteofabbri/AspNetCore.Identity.Mongo with Blazor server web app.
The first goal was to have an EditForm (CreateUserForm.razor) in Blazor for adding a user to the Identity Mongodb.

Fixed error "No converter registered for type" per vova3211's suggestion in
https://github.com/matteofabbri/AspNetCore.Identity.Mongo/issues/139#issuecomment-2647247644
